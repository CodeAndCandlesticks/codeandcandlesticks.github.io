## Welcome

Hello! I'm Luis, a Technical Program Manager at Square / Block Inc, and an avid stock market trader and developer by night. With a robust background as an electrical engineer and over eight years of experience in fintech, I blend deep technical expertise with a strategic vision in BSA compliance and trading technologies.

## Professional Journey

My journey began in the telecommunications field, where I first engaged with technology by reverse-engineering firmware to override it's security and deploy it to other units. This role carved out my path towards fintech, leading me to impactful positions at Xoom / PayPal and now at Square. At PayPal, I designed and implemented a risk-based experience framework which improved customer experience and company's bottom line while ensuring compliance adherence.

## Trading and Development

Trading piqued my interest early on, driving me to not only master trading strategies but also to engineer sophisticated tools to automate and enhance trading processes. My night hours are dedicated to refining my proprietary Python-based backtesting engine and developing a trading bot. This work encapsulates my passion for blending technology with trading to achieve financial freedom.

## Product Management

In product management, I focus on empathizing with customers to ensure that our technical solutions address real-world problems efficiently. My approach has always been customer-centric, ensuring that every product I manage directly contributes to enhancing user experience and achieving business goals.

## Passions and Personal Life

I'm not all tech and trading. Outside of work, I'm a dedicated father and an enthusiastic volunteer at my son's school. I believe in the power of technology education and dream of a future where I can dedicate more time to teaching others. I also enjoy playing drums, wing surfing, and other high-speed watersports.

## Personal Philosophy

"El fracaso est√° garantizado, si no se hace el intento." - Failure is guaranteed if you never try.
