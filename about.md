About Luis P Perez

## A Fusion of Technology and Trading

Hello! I'm Luis P Perez, the creator of Code and Candlesticks. With a professional background in electrical engineering and software development, I've spent the last several years merging my technical expertise with my passion for the stock market.

## My Journey
My journey into the world of technology began with a degree in electrical engineering, which laid the foundation for my analytical and problem-solving skills. After several years of working at various financial services companies, where I honed my skills in Python and data analytics, I discovered a new passion: the financial markets.

This discovery was not just about understanding economic trends but also about how technology could transform trading strategies. From automating trades to analyzing vast datasets for insights, I realized that technology and trading are a perfect match.

## Why Code and Candlesticks?

Code and Candlesticks is born out of my desire to document and share my unique journey at the nexus of coding and trading. This platform serves as a conduit for me to explore and explain the sophisticated ways in which software engineering can be applied to solve complex trading challenges.

## What I Do

- Financial Analysis: Using data analytics tools to decipher market trends and make informed trading decisions.
- Educate and Share: Through blog posts, tutorials, and project insights, I aim to share my knowledge and learn from the community.
